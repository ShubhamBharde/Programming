# Core CS Concept & Definitions

## Computer Science:-

- In Laymenst/simple term, It is study of data, data transformation & data presentation.

- âœ… Computer science is the study of how computers process, store, and analyze data, as well as how to design software and systems to solve problems.

## Computer :-

- It is an electronic device that can manipulate data & perform some task based on a program/set of instructions.

- Computer's can't do anything without a program that's why it is called as Dumb machine.

### Key Components of a Computer :-

1. Central Processing Unit (CPU): The "brain" of the computer, responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations.

1. Memory (RAM): Temporary storage that holds data and instructions that the CPU needs while performing tasks.

1. Storage: Permanent storage for data and programs, typically in the form of hard drives or solid-state drives.

1. Input Devices: Tools for entering data into the computer, such as a keyboard, mouse, or microphone.

1. Output Devices: Tools for receiving information from the computer, such as a monitor, printer, or speakers.

1. Motherboard: The main circuit board that connects all components of the computer.

1. Power Supply: Provides electrical power to the computer.

### Basic Functions of a Computer :-

1. Input: Receiving data from input devices.

1. Processing: Performing calculations or operations on the data.

1. Storage: Saving data for later use.

1. Output: Displaying results to the user.

## Programming Language :-

- It is a way to talk/communicate with the machines
